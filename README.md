# Functions-and-Graphics in Assembly

## DESCRIPTION
In this lab, you will implement functions that perform some primitive graphics operations on a small simulated display. 
These functions will allow users to change the background color of the display, and “draw” horizontal and vertical lines on the display.
To simulate a display, we’ll be using the memory-mapped bitmap graphics display tool included with MARS.

## FILES
1. graphics.asm - This file includes the assembly code of the lab.

2. main-test-all.asm - Allows us to see the visual bitmap display that is coded into lab4.asm.

3. README.md - This file explains the contents fo the lab.

## INSTRUCTIONS
This program is intended to be run using the MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator
(MARS). Enter the test case as a program argument and run using MARS.
