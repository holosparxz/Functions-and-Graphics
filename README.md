# Functions-and-Graphics in Assembly
Program draws various shapes and patterns in MIPS Assembler and ran in MARS.
## DESCRIPTION
I implemented functions that perform some primitive graphics operations on a small simulated display. 
These functions allows users to change the background color of the display, and “draw” horizontal and vertical lines on the display.
To simulate a display, I used the memory-mapped bitmap graphics display tool included with MARS.

## FILES
1. graphics.asm - This file includes the assembly code of the lab.

2. main-test-all.asm - Allows us to see the visual bitmap display that is coded into graphics.asm.

3. README.md - This file explains the contents fo the lab.

## INSTRUCTIONS
This program is intended to be run using the MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator
(MARS). Enter the test case as a program argument and run using MARS.
